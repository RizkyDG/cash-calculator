#Cash Calculator
Created to help me quickly count the safe in my role as a Shift Supervisor at Starbucks.

I made a thing to make it easier to count money. It works like this:

1. Type in how many rolls of coins you have.

2. Type in total dollar amounts.

3. It calculates everything.

4. Profit.

The icon was sourced from a quick Google Images search.
